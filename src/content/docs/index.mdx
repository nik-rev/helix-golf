import { Card, CardGrid, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Hexagons from "../../Hexagons.astro";

<Hexagons />

_For all examples, we'll assume that your cursor is on the very first character_

#### Object into Array

##### Before

```js
const palette = {
  apricot: "#f47868",
  lightning: "#ffcd1c",
  delta: "6f44f0",
};
```

##### After

```js
const palette = [
  ["apricot", "#f47868"],
  ["lightning", "#ffcd1c"],
  ["delta", "6f44f0"],
];
```

##### Command

:::tip

You can click on the commands and it will explain in detail every step

:::

<details>

<summary>
`jmr{[mi[s:<enter>r,t,;vgsms[lems"`
</summary>

1. Go to the line below with `j`, this is because we need to be inside of the object for the next step.
1. `mr{[` replaces the nearest pair of curly braces "\{" with square brackets "["
1. `mi[` selects inside the entire array
1. Use `s` to enter select mode, which searches inside our selection and creates sub-selections based on a pattern
1. Input `:` and then hit `Enter`, which will place a cursor on every ":" creating many single-width selections
1. `r,` replaces each selection with a ",". Essentially we've replaced each colon with a comma
1. `t,` moves the cursor on each line to the ending comma
1. `;` collapses the selection around each cursor into a single selection
1. `vgs` selects each line excluding the final comma
1. `ms[` surrounds each individual selection with "[" to turn it into an array. We're almost done here. We just need to transform the first item in each sub-array into a string.
1. `l` moves 1 character forward, replacing the selection with just a 1-width selection
1. `e` selects until the end of each word. Since we start at the first character and select until the end, this selects the entire word.
1. `ms"` surrounds each word with double quotes to make strings

</details>

#### CSV to SQL

##### Before

```csv
id 1,Item 1,cost 1,location 1
id 2,Item 2,cost 2,location 2
id 10,Item 10,cost 10,location 10
```

##### After

```sql
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 1','Item 1','Cost 1','Location 1');
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 2','Item 2','Cost 2','Location 2');
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 10','Item 10','Cost 10','Location 10');
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
```%<alt-s>"yys\d<enter>dhhbms``x_ms(IINSERT INTO `database<esc>a.`table<esc>la <esc>AVALUES (<esc>"yPS,<enter>ms'A;<esc>Fl;~```
</summary>

1.  `%` selects full file
1.  `Alt` + `s` split selection into multiple selections on newlines
1.  `"yy` yanks the selections into "y" register. We'll need it for later
1.  `s` and then input the pattern `\d` then `Enter` which creates a selection on all digits
1.  `d` deletes the selections. Essentially we've removed all the digits.
1.  `hh` goes backwards 2 chars, important to make sure we are at the end of each word
1.  Use `b` to select till the beginning of every word, which also nicely selects all the words that there are
1.  `` ms` `` surrounds each word with a backtick
1.  `` ` `` switches all characters to lowercase
1.  `x` selects each line then use `_` to trim the trailing whitespace
1.  `ms(` surrounds each line with parentheses
1.  `I` goes into insert mode at the beginning of each line
1.  Type the following:

        ```
        INSERT INTO `database
        ```

1.  `Escape` goes back to normal mode
1.  `a` to go into insert mode after the backtick then type:

        ```
        .`table
        ```

1.  `Escape` goes back into normal mode, then `la` to enter insert mode just before the opening parentheses
1.  Add a `Space` then `Escape` to go back into normal mode again
1.  `A` goes into insert mode at the end of each line, now type:

        ```
        VALUES (
        ```

1.  Hit `Escape` to leave insert mode. Your cursor will be at the closing parenthesis.
1.  `"yP` pastes our previously yanked items from the "y" register
1.  `S,<enter>` splits current selection into multiple selections on each comma
1.  `ms'` surrounds each item with a single quote
1.  `A;` adds a semicolon at the end of each line
1.  `Escape` goes back to normal mode and `Fl` to place your cursor on the lowercase "l" of each "location"
1.  `;` collapses each selection into a single-width selection
1.  `~` toggles the case for each "l" into "L"

</details>

#### Text into Array

##### Before

```
Hello
This
Is
Helix
```

##### After

```js
[ "Hello", "This", "Is", "Helix" ]
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
`%<A-s>ms"<A-J>i,<esc>xms ms[`
</summary>

1. `%` selects full file
1. `<A-s>` split selection into multiple selections on newlines
1. `ms"` surrounds each word with `"`'s
1. `<A-J>i,` join lines inside selection, select the inserted space, and insert `,`'s
1. `<esc>xms ` enter normal mode, select line and surround by spaces
1. `ms[` surround by `[]`

</details>

#### Convert functions into a class

##### Before

```py
def calculate_area(length, width):
	result = length * width
	return result

def calculate_perimiter(length, width):
	result = 2 * (length + width)
	return result

def calculate_volume(length, width, height):
	result = length * width * height
	return result
```

##### After

```py
class Calculator
	@staticmethod
	def get_area(len, wid):
		return len * wid

	@staticmethod
	def get_perimiter(len, wid):
		return 2 * (len + wid)

	@staticmethod
	def get_volume(len, wid, hei):
		return len * wid * hei
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
``%scalculate<enter>cget<esc>O@staticmethod<esc>jxxs\w+<enter>slength|width|height<enter>bllled%sresult =<enter>C<alt-(>;ddss<enter>xd%>O<backspace>class Calculator:``
</summary>

1.  `%` selects the entire file
1.  `s` searches inside the current selection and creates sub-selections based on a pattern. Input `calculate` then hit `Enter` to make a selection on all instances of the word
1.  `c` then type `get` to change each "calculate" word into a "get"
1.  `Escape` to go back to normal mode
1.  Use `O` to create an empty line above each cursor, write:

        ```
        @staticmethod
        ```

1.  Hit `Esc` to go into normal mode.
1.  We need to select 2 lines below the current line, first go down with `j` and then press `xx` which will select the current line, and then select the next line
    In total we now have 3 cursors each with 2 lines selected, which includes the first line of the bodies of each function and the function definition themselves

1.  `s` brings up a prompt to select sub-selections by a given regex. The `\w+` regex selects each word, type it and then `Enter`
1.  `s` again then type `length|width|height` followed by `Enter`. This will look at the contents of the current selections, and create sub-selections where it finds the regex which means "length or width or height". So we select each instance of those 3 words
1.  Our cursor is currently at the end of each word. Let's go to the beginning with `b`
1.  We want to keep the first 3 characters and discard the rest from each of the parameters. To do this, move to the 4th character with `lll`
1.  Use `e` to select until the end of each word and then `d` to delete it
1.  Select the entire file again with `%` followed by `s` to bring up selection prompt again
1.  Write `result =` followed by `Enter` to select all instances of that string
1.  `C` creates a new selection on the line directly below, for each cursor
1.  Use `Alt` + `(` to rotate the _contents_ of the selection backward
1.  `;` collapses each cursor into a single selection
1.  `dd` deletes two characters on each of the 6 lines
1.  `s` to bring up the prompt, then input `s` followed by `Enter` to select all "s" characters
1.  Select each of the lines with `x` followed by `d` to delete
1.  Select whole file with `%` and indent with `>`
1.  `O` creates a newline above and enters Insert mode, then `Backspace` to delete an extra tab
1.  Write this:

        ```
        class Calculator:
        ```

</details>
