import Hexagons from "../../Hexagons.astro";

<Hexagons />

*For all examples, we'll assume that your cursor is on the very first character*

#### Object into Array

##### Before

```js
const palette = {
	apricot: "#f47868",
	lightning: "#ffcd1c",
	delta: "6f44f0",
};
```

##### After

```js
const palette = [
	["apricot", "#f47868"],
	["lightning", "#fccd1c"],
	["delta", "6f44f0"],
];
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
`mr{[mi[s:<enter>r,t,;vgsms[lems"`
</summary>

1. Go inside of the object with `j`
1. `mr{[` replaces the surrounding "\{" with "["
1. `mi[` selects inside the entire array
1. Use `s` to enter select mode, which searches inside our selection and creates sub-selections based on a pattern
1. Input `:` and then hit `Enter`, which will place a cursor on every ":" creating many single-width selections
1. `r,` replaces each selection with a ",". Essentially we've replaced each colon with a comma
1. `t,` moves the cursor on each line to the ending comma
1. `;` collapses the selection around each cursor into a single selection
1. `vgs` selects each line excluding the final comma
1. `ms[` surrounds each individual selection with "[" to turn it into an array. We're almost done here. We just need to transform the first item in each sub-array into a string.
1. `l` moves 1 character forward, replacing the selection with just a 1-width selection
1. `e` selects until the end of each word. Since we start at the first character and select until the end, this selects the entire word.
1. `ms"` surrounds each word with double quotes to make strings

</details>

#### CSV to SQL

##### Before

```csv
id 1,Item 1,cost 1,location 1
id 2,Item 2,cost 2,location 2
id 10,Item 10,cost 10,location 10
```

##### After

```sql
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 1','Item 1','Cost 1','Location 1'); 
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 2','Item 2','Cost 2','Location 2');
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 10','Item 10','Cost 10','Location 10');
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
```%<alt-s>"yys\d<enter>dhhbms``xms(IINSERT INTO `database<esc>a.`table<esc>la <esc>AVALUES (<esc>"ypS,ms'A;<esc>Fl;~```
</summary>

1. `%` selects full file
1. `Alt` + `s` split selection into multiple selections on newlines
1. `"yy` yanks the selections into "y" register. We'll need it for later
1. `s` and then input the pattern `\d` then `Enter` which creates a selection on all digits
1. `d` deletes the selections. Essentially we've removed all the digits.
1. `hh` goes backwards 2 chars, important to make sure we are at the end of each word
1. Use `b` to select till the beginning of every word, which also nicely selects all the words that there are
1. `ms` ` surrounds each word with a backtick
1. ` ` ` switches all characters to lowercase
1. `x` selects each line then use `_` to trim the trailing whitespace
1. `ms(` surrounds each line with parentheses
1. `I` goes into insert mode at the beginning of each line
1. Type the following:

		```
		INSERT INTO `database
		```

1. `Escape` goes back to normal mode
1. `a` to go into insert mode after the backtick then type:

		```
		.`table
		```
1. `Escape` goes back into normal mode, then `la` to enter insert mode just before the opening parentheses
1. Add a `Space` then `Escape` to go back into normal mode again
1. `A` goes into insert mode at the end of each line, now type:

		```
		VALUES (
		```

1. Hit `Escape` to leave insert mode. Your cursor will be at the closing parenthesis. 
1. `"yp` pastes our previously yanked items from the "y" register
1. `S,` splits current selection into multiple selections on each comma
1. `ms'` surrounds each item with a single quote
1. `A;` adds a semicolon at the end of each line
1. `Escape` goes back to normal mode and `Fl` to place your cursor on the lowercase "l" of each "location"
1. `;` collapses each selection into a single-width selection
1. `~` toggles the case for each "l" into "L"

</details>

#### Convert functions into a class

##### Before

```py
def calculate_area(length, width):
	result = length * width
	return result

def calculate_perimiter(length, width):
	result = 2 * (length + width)
	return result

def calculate_volume(length, width, height):
	result = length * width * height
	return result
```

##### After

```py
class Calculator
	@staticmethod
	def get_area(len, wid):
		return len * wid

	@staticmethod
	def get_perimiter(len, wid):
		return 2 * (len + wid)

	@staticmethod
	def get_volume(len, wid, hei):
		return len * wid * hei
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
``%scalculate<enter>cget<esc>O@staticmethod<esc>jxxs\w+<enter>slength|width|height<enter>bllled%sresult =<enter>C<alt-(>;ddss<enter>xd%>O<backspace>class Calculator:``
</summary>

1. `%` selects the entire file
1. `s` searches inside the current selection and creates sub-selections based on a pattern. Input `calculate` then hit `Enter` to make a selection on all instances of the word
1. `c` then type `get` to change each "calculate" word into a "get"
1. `Escape` to go back to normal mode
1. Use `O` to create an empty line above each cursor, write:

		```
		@staticmethod
		```

1. Hit `Esc` to go into normal mode.
1. We need to select 2 lines below the current line, first go down with `j` and then press `xx` which will select the current line, and then select the next line
		In total we now have 3 cursors each with 2 lines selected, which includes the first line of the bodies of each function and the function definition themselves

1. `s` brings up a prompt to select sub-selections by a given regex. The `\w+` regex selects each word, type it and then `Enter`
1. `s` again then type `length|width|height` followed by `Enter`. This will look at the contents of the current selections, and create sub-selections where it finds the regex which means "length or width or height". So we select each instance of those 3 words
1. Our cursor is currently at the end of each word. Let's go to the beginning with `b`
1. We want to keep the first 3 characters and discard the rest from each of the parameters. To do this, move to the 4th character with `lll`
1. Use `e` to select until the end of each word and then `d` to delete it
1. Select the entire file again with `%` followed by `s` to bring up selection prompt again
1. Write `result =` followed by `Enter` to select all instances of that string
1. `C` creates a new selection on the line directly below, for each cursor
1. Use `Alt` + `(` to rotate the *contents* of the selection backward
1. `;` collapses each cursor into a single selection
1. `dd` deletes two characters on each of the 6 lines
1. `s` to bring up the prompt, then input `s` followed by `Enter` to select all "s" characters
1. Select each of the lines with `x` followed by `d` to delete
1. Select whole file with `%` and indent with `>`
1. `O` creates a newline above and enters Insert mode, then `Backspace` to delete an extra tab
1. Write this:

		```
		class Calculator:
		```
