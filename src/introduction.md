# Helix Golf

Helix Golf is a collection of refactoring examples using the [Helix Editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix), a next generation terminal IDE written in Rust.

Each example is described in-depth, is tested using the latest version of Helix and has a satisfying video demo. Examples aren't just made-up, all of them were created from real situations.

In many cases the Helix Golf examples are much easier to understand and come up with on your own than similar Vim Golf examples, while often being shorter due to multiple cursors being a core editing primitive in Helix.

This makes Helix a perfect swiss army knife text-editor for developers and anyone who seeks to become faster at editing text. It's not just about becoming more productive - it's also really fun!
